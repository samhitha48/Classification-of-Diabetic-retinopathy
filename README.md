# Classification-of-Diabetic-retinopathy

Diabetic retinopathy is ophthalmological distress caused by clots, lesions or bleeding in the light-sensitive area of the retina in diabetic patients. Blocking of vessels causes new vessel growth, which gives birth to mesh-like structures, which is caused by an increase in blood sugar. Ophthalmologists must assess the branching retinal vasculature in order to provide an accurate diagnosis. Pre-processing of the fundus scans of the eye is done followed by segmentation. For segmentation any feature extraction operator will suffice. To train the classifier for categorization, we employed a ResNet model and further used SVM for classification. We employ the DIARETDB1 (standard Diabetic Retinopathy Dataset) and a dataset provided by a medical institution, which includes fundus. images of both abnormal and normal retinas to evaluate the proposed algorithm's performance. The entire project is done in MATLAB.
